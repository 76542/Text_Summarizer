The Supreme Court is set to hear multiple petitions challenging the amended Waqf law, which governs the administration of Muslim charitable properties. The law, recently passed after intense parliamentary debate, has been opposed by political parties, religious organizations, and NGOs, who claim it violates constitutional rights and discriminates against Muslims. Six BJP-ruled states support the amendment and are seeking to defend it in court. Petitioners have raised concerns over inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf boards and the revocation of protections for Waqf properties. The government defends the law as a property management reform aimed at reducing corruption. Protests, particularly in Bengal, have led to deaths and unrest.
