Some of the petitions have demanded that the law be cancelled, calling it unconstitutional. Others want the court to stop its implementation. It has also been termed arbitrary and discriminatory against Muslims.
In his petition, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the updated law abolishes the protections given to Waqfs. Diminishing the protection given to Waqf properties while retaining it for other religious is discriminatory, he has claimed.
AAP's Amanatullah Khan, in his petition, has argued that the inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf boards is violative of Article 14, and it does not have any rational connection with the purpose of religious property administration.
The government has maintained that the bill is about property and its management, not religion. There are largescale irregularities in the management of Waqf properties and their proceeds do not help impoverished Muslims or women and children, which the amended law would rectify, it has said.
